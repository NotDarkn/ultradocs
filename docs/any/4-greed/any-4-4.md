    <b>Difficulty</b>: Slightly Easy (2/5)
</font>

[CSB](/speedrun-tech.md#core-snipe-boosts) through the red doors as the open, and slam on to  the blue bounce pad<br/>
Bounce pads give you 160 vu/s (Vertical Units / Second) and diminishes to ~45 vu/s when you reach the top. Ground slamming on the pads give you 200 vu/s and only diminish to ~120 vu/s when you reach the top. This saves ~1 second<br/>
Slam and dash slide to the door and whiplash the skull [Dash jump](/speedrun-tech.md#dash-jump) around the skull pedestal <br/>
[CE boost](/speedrun-tech.md#ce-boost-core-eject-boost) up to the bounce pad and slam on it for extra speed <br/>
Slam down and place the skull, dash slide through the doors, then [CE boost](/speedrun-tech.md#ce-boost-core-eject-boost) to the checkpoint <br/>

### Rocket Ultraboost 
<font size="2">
    <b>Difficulty</b>: Intermediate (3/5)
</font>

While aligned with the initial spawn, walk towards the door before the ramp, aim in-between the side grey line and the center dark red line as pictured below: <br/>
Once aligned, shoot the rocket and freeze it when it’s halfway between you and the door.<br/>
Slide down the ramp and once past the rocket, shoot it with the malicious railcannon.<br/>
Make sure to hold slide until you make it to the blue bounce pad, then slam down onto it.<br/>

## Blue Skull + Checkpoint


Once up after the first bounce pad, go to the right door and grab the blue skull with your whiplash and dashjump over to the next bounce pad.
You can either use a combination of slide jumps to get up to the ramp and ground slam on the bounce pad (Easy), or you can use a [Floor FUP](/speedrun-tech.md#floor-fup) while holding forward (Intermediate) to get to the bounce pad. Once at the top, you can either dash when parallel with the floor or you can ride the cuved ceiling to the blue pedestal, and place the skull.


Once in the main hallway, either [CE boost](/speedrun-tech.md#ce-boost-core-eject-boost) or backwards [Floor FUP](/speedrun-tech.md#floor-fup) and use oil to slide through the door, exampled [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL9yqzN7K0A)
