        <b>Third Room Clip</b> // <b>DIFFICULTY</b>: /10
    </summary>
    <p>
     Start off by firing saws from the overheat sawblade launcher to heat the alternate fire and continue firing until the overheat saw is used, then perform a <a href="/speedrun-tech#slam-store">Slam Store</a> in the hallway of the starting room and slide. When you land <a href="/speedrun-tech#slide-jump">Slide Jump</a> then fire the overheat saw as you go through the door into the first arena so that it bounces between the two doors. Then slide when you land to start the arena.
     <p>
      </p>
      Start charging an overpump and position yourself centered between the two malicious faces and directly in front of the swordsmachine. Parry the swordsmachine, then look down. Wait until one of the malicious face orbs hit you, then fire the overpump. The inviciblility from getting hit will prevent the overpump from damaging you and the explosion will reflect the orbs back, killing both malicious faces.
      <p>
      </p>
      Stand against the door and to the side, slam after the shockwave bounces you, then <a href="/speedrun-tech#dash-jump">Dash Jump</a>, then slide jump to get to the top of the stairs. Turn right and stand against the wall, activate freezeframe and jump. Place a frozen rocket at the peak of your jump so that it is partially in the ceiling, then move to the wall behind you and <a href="/speedrun-tech#dives">Dive</a>, holding the slide input. If done correctly landing on the rocket will clip you out of bounds. 
      <p>
      </p>
      Turn right and <a href="/speedrun-tech#flick-ub">Flick UB</a> towards the checkpoint, once you are lower down than the checkpoint, <a href="/speedrun-tech#instant-rocket-ride">Instant Rocket Ride</a> to reach it, then checkpoint

    <p>
     Start by <a href="/speedrun-tech#dash-jump">Dash Jumping</a> into the right side of the red room hallway and then performing a <a href="/speedrun-tech#ce-boost-core-eject-boost">Slam Store</a>, then wall jump off of the left side and land centered in the hallway in and dive, holding the slide input. 
     <p>
      </p>
      Look up at a 45 degree angle, activate freezeframe, and fire a rocket as you hit the ceiling to clip through.
      <p>
      </p>
      Angle slightly to the left, dash backwards, and <a href="/speedrun-tech#ub-ultraboost">UB</a>. Once you are over top of the checkpoint, slam and dash to collect it, then checkpoint

     <a href="/speedrun-tech#dash-jump">Dash Jump</a> into the arena, slam jump and throw 3 coins aiming at eye level and slightly to the left. Slam jump again while moving forward, and <a href="/speedrun-tech#slab-coin">Slab Coin</a> the 3 coins to kill the left hideous mass. Ideally you want to fire the piercer shot slightly before the hideous mass spawns as shots take time to travel between coins.
      <p>
      </p>
      Whiplash the hideous mass on the right, start firing saws while placing 3 magnets on the hideous mass's weakpoint, then jumpstart it, knuckleblast it and continue firing saws from the blue sawblade launcher to proc jumpstart and kill the hideous mass. You can stop firing saws slightly before it dies.
      <p>
      </p>
      Slam jump and place a line of oil along the stairs in the center, then fire a rocket to ignite it, then dash towards where the cerberus spawns and place a magnet at the top of the stairs. Fire all of your blue saws and place an additional magnet so the sawtrap will hit the cerberus. Fire the overheat saw into the sawtrap, and charge a core eject. 
      <p>
      </p>
      Wait until the swordsmachine walks into the saws, then fire the core towards the middle of the room and <a href="/speedrun-tech#nukes">Nuke</a> so that it kills the 2 strays and damages the swordsmachine and cerberus, dash to the right to avoid the nuke and <a href="/speedrun-tech#ce-boost-core-eject-boost">CE Boost</a> from next to the swordsmachine over to the other cerberus. Split coin the second set of strays then whiplash to the cerberus and <a href="/speedrun-tech#s-r-s-combo">SRS Combo</a>
      <p>
      </p>
      <a href="/speedrun-tech#instatnt-rocket-ride">Instant Rocket Ride</a> to reach the exit and <a href="/speedrun-tech#ce-boost-exit">CE Boost Exit</a>
