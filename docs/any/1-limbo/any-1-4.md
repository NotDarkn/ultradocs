As you’re entering the window, <a href="/speedrun-tech#multi-deadcoin">Double Deadcoin</a> and punch it as soon as possible.

Slam around where the puddle/v2 land area is located, And aim in the center just above the window where the punched coin is located.
try to deadcoin <b> as soon as possible </b>. (it will only work if the coin is in split state) 

make sure when you are deadcoining to delay your coin throw more than usual.
This will both split the coin into V2 with a richoshot and deadcoin your coin.


Finnaly finish the kill by only having to punch the coin twice.
