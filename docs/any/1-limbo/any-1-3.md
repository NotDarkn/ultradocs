### Soapless Kill

      <p>
      </p>
     <a href="/speedrun-tech#dsj-dash-slide-jump">DSJ</a> into the boss room.
      <p>
      </p>
     As soon as the boss’s arms move checkpoint to get the faster spawn animation.
      <p>
      </p>
     Pause buffering can make timing this easier.
      <p>
      </p>
     <a href="/speedrun-tech#dsj-dash-slide-jump">DSJ</a> into the arena while firing blue saws, place a magnet behind the arms, then fire an overheat saw just before the boss spawns.
      <p>
      </p>
     As soon as the boss spawns, attatch the jumpstart cable to its weakpoint, jump and look down, throw a coin and <a href="/speedrun-tech#coin-punch">Coin Punch</a> it.

     Move towards the exit to time a <a href="/speedrun-tech#slam-store-exit">Slam Store</a>.
      <p>
      </p>
     You want to start your <a href="/speedrun-tech#dsj-dash-slide-jump">Slam Store</a> right before the boss gibs. This may require some practice to get used to.

        Note
    </div>
    This kill is somewhat inconsistent due to hideous mass weakpoints, if you are doing everthing and it isn't killing, you are probably not hitting weakpoint with either your sawtrap or railcoin.
