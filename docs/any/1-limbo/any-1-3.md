<div class="hidden-header">

###### Soap Kill

</div>

<details class="easy">
    <summary>
        <b>Soap Kill</b> // <b>DIFFICULTY</b>: 1/10

        Dash, turn right, and dash jump into the soap room.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fire a rocket at the ceiling to break the grate, slam, then fire malicious rail down to boost up and grab the soap with whiplash. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="/speedrun-tech#dsdash-jump">Dash Jump</a> backwards, slam then <a href="/speedrun-tech#dsce-boost-core-eject-boost">CE Boost</a> down the corridor. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Slam down before the checkpoint. <a href="/speedrun-tech#dsce-boost-core-eject-boost">CE Boost</a> through the checkpoint and into the boss room, as soon as the boss’s arms move checkpoint so it does the faster spawn animation.
            Dash jump into the arena
    </p>
    <p>
        Whiplash the boss to kill it as soon as it is vulnerable.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="/speedrun-tech#ub-exit">UB Exit</a>.

###### Soapless Kill

</div>

<details class="medium">
    <summary>
        <b> Soapless kill </b> // <b>DIFFICULTY</b>: 4/10
    </summary>
    <p>
        Dash backwards, turn around and place the blue skull with whiplash, dash towards the door, <a href="/speedrun-tech#ce-boost-core-eject-boost">CE Boost</a> down the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
        Slam down before the checkpoint.
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="/speedrun-tech#dsj-dash-slide-jump">DSJ</a> into the boss room.
    </p>
    <p>
        As soon as the boss’s arms move checkpoint to get the faster spawn animation.
    </p>
    <p>
        ::: note
        Pause buffering can make timing this easier
        :::
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="/speedrun-tech#dsj-dash-slide-jump">DSJ</a> into the arena while firing blue saws, place a magnet behind the arms, then fire an overheat saw just before the boss spawns.
    </p>
    <p>
        As soon as the boss spawns, attatch the jumpstart cable to its weakpoint, jump and look down, throw a coin and <a href="/speedrun-tech#coin-punch">Coin Punch</a> it. Slam, then throw another coin into the bosses weakpoint. Shoot your erail towards the coin to <a href="/speedrun-tech#railcoins">Railcoin</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finish off the boss with an <a href="/speedrun-tech#s-r-s-combo">SRS Combo</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Move towards the exit to time a <a href="/speedrun-tech#slideways-exit">Slideways Exit</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        You want to start your <a href="/speedrun-tech#dsj-dash-slide-jump">Slam Store</a> right before the boss gibs. This may require some practice to get used to.

    </p>
    <p>
        This kill is somewhat inconsistent due to hideous mass weakpoints, if you are doing everthing and it isn't killing, you are probably not hitting weakpoint with either your sawtrap or railcoin.
